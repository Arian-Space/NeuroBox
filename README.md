The GitHub repository for the NeuroBox app hosts the source code and resources for a Windows application Iâ€™ve been working on. NeuroBox provides a user-friendly interface and options for interacting with Ollama and GGUF models from Hugging Face. Currently, the app is available for download only as a Windows installer package named "neurobox_0.1.0_x64_en-US".

### Key Features
- **Purpose**: NeuroBox simplifies the process of using Ollama, an application that allows users to run large language models (LLMs) locally, and GGUF models, which are optimized binary-format models from Hugging Face designed for efficient inference.
- **Interface**: The app offers an intuitive UI, making it easy to download, install, and manage these models without dealing with complex technical details.
- **Functionality**: Users can select and load GGUF models, configure settings, and potentially run inference tasks directly within the app.

### Current Status
- **Platform**: The app is tailored for Windows, with the installer "neurobox_0.1.0_x64_en-US" being the only distribution method at this time.
- **Development**: This is an ongoing project, and the repository likely includes the source code, documentation, and other materials to support its development and future contributions.

In short, the NeuroBox GitHub repository is the home for this Windows-specific app, designed to make working with Ollama and GGUF models from Hugging Face accessible and straightforward for users.
